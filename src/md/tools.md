Refresher is a basic tool that will refresh your browser. It might not
seem like it, but command-tabbing back to an already refreshed browser
helps. A lot.


    # Refresh first tab in Chrome when anything in src/clj changes
    lein run -m nsfw.refresher

    # Refresh first tab in safari when anything in src/clj, src/cljs, or
    # src/md changes
    lein run -m nsfw.refresher safari src/clj src/cljs src/md
